# Patent Notice

This software implements patent-pending technology owned by Next Shift Consulting LLC.

## Patent-Pending Technology

The following inventions are the subject of pending patent applications:

### 1. RSCT (Representation-Space Compatibility Theory)
A novel methodology for certifying AI/LLM execution quality through representation-solver compatibility analysis.

**Key innovations:**
- Compatibility scoring between semantic representations and solver capabilities
- Quality certification methodology for AI outputs
- Predictive quality metrics based on representation-solver fit

### 2. κ-Gate Enforcement System
A quality gate system for AI/LLM governance using hierarchical kappa metrics.

**Key innovations:**
- Minimum quality thresholds (κ-gate) for AI execution approval
- Multi-level quality gates for different execution contexts
- Automatic execution blocking based on compatibility scores

### 3. Multi-Agent Swarm Certification
Consensus-based certification protocol for agent-to-agent communications.

**Key innovations:**
- Distributed certification across agent swarms
- Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus scoring
- Agent reputation and trust propagation

### 4. Multimodal Kappa Decomposition
Hierarchical compatibility scoring for multimodal AI systems.

**Key innovations:**
- Decomposition into κ_H (high-level), κ_L (low-level), κ_interface
- Cross-modal compatibility analysis
- Hierarchical quality gate enforcement

## Patent Grant (Apache 2.0)

Section 3 of the Apache License 2.0 grants:

> "...a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
> irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
> have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
> the Work..."

**With defensive termination:**

> "If You institute patent litigation against any entity...alleging
> that the Work...constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
> then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that
> Work shall terminate..."

This provides strong protection against patent trolls while allowing legitimate use.
