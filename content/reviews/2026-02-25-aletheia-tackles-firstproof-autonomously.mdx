## Overview

## Unleashing Mathematical Creativity: The Significance of Aletheia in the FirstProof Challenge

The research paper titled "Aletheia tackles FirstProof autonomously" presents groundbreaking advancements in the application of artificial intelligence to mathematical problem-solving. The authors report that Aletheia, a mathematics research agent powered by Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think, successfully solved 6 out of 10 problems in the inaugural FirstProof challenge. This challenge serves as a benchmark for assessing AI's capability to tackle complex mathematical proofs, emphasizing both the potential and limitations of machine-driven reasoning. The results highlight Aletheia's impressive ability to engage autonomously with mathematical concepts, demonstrating not only its advanced computational power but also its emerging capacity for creative thought in an academic domain traditionally reserved for human intellect.

The paper offers several key technical contributions that merit attention. First, it provides a clear example of how AI can reason and arrive at solutions to mathematical problems autonomously, a process that traditionally requires extensive human expertise. Second, the authors detail their methodology by explicitly sharing the raw prompts and outputs through a public GitHub repository, which furthers the transparency and accessibility of the research. This openness allows other researchers to replicate their studies or build upon Aletheia’s findings, fostering a collaborative environment in the AI research community. Moreover, the nuanced discussion surrounding the unanimous assessment of solutions, particularly with respect to Problem 8, raises important questions about the reliability and interpretability of AI-driven proofs.

From a broader perspective, the implications of Aletheia's performance touch on vital themes in AI safety and the evolving role of multi-agent systems. As AI systems become more autonomous, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial to ensuring they align with human values and expectations. The exploration of Aletheia's abilities may inform the development of frameworks that prioritize safety and transparency, critical as AI technologies interact more frequently with complex human-oriented tasks. Additionally, this study contributes to the field of representation learning by showcasing how effective AI systems can encode mathematical knowledge and reasoning pathways, pressing forward the ongoing dialogue about the potential of AI to enhance academic inquiry, expand human understanding, and possibly even redefine the boundaries of creativity in scientific research.

## Abstract

> We report the performance of Aletheia (Feng et al., 2026b), a mathematics research agent powered by Gemini 3 Deep Think, on the inaugural FirstProof challenge. Within the allowed timeframe of the challenge, Aletheia autonomously solved 6 problems (2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of 10 according to majority expert assessments; we note that experts were not unanimous on Problem 8 (only). For full transparency, we explain our interpretation of FirstProof and disclose details about our experiments as well as our evaluation. Raw prompts and outputs are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/superhuman/tree/main/aletheia.
