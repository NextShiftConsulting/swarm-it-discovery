## Overview

## The Significance of "On Data Engineering for Scaling LLM Terminal Capabilities"

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) have made unprecedented strides in their capabilities. Yet, a critical aspect remains largely unexplored: the training data and data engineering practices that underpin these sophisticated systems. The research paper titled "On Data Engineering for Scaling LLM Terminal Capabilities" seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by providing a systematic study of data engineering practices specifically for terminal agents. Its significance lies in the introduction of innovative methodologies that enhance our understanding and development of LLMs, thereby contributing to the next generation of intelligent agents capable of complex tasks.

The paper contributes two major advancements to the field. Firstly, it introduces the **Terminal-Task-Gen**, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that facilitates the construction of tasks based on specific seeds and skills. This tool not only streamlines the process of creating diverse training tasks but also fosters a more nuanced approach to data generation tailored for terminal applications. Secondly, the authors deliver a thorough analysis of various training strategies, including filtering methods, curriculum learning, long context training, and examination of scaling behaviors. These insights culminate in the development of the **Terminal-Corpus**, a large-scale open-source dataset designed to support terminal tasks. The pipeline shows tangible results, with the trained models from the Nemotron-Terminal family demonstrating significant performance improvements on the benchmark test Terminal-Bench 2.0.

Moreover, the implications of this research extend beyond just enhancing performance metrics. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent frameworks, understanding the data engineering processes informs better design practices that enhance robustness and safety in AI applications. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI safety by underscoring the importance of well-structured training data and the risks associated with poor data practices. Additionally, the systematic approach to representation learning introduced in the paper emphasizes the necessity for models capable of understanding more complex and contextualized inputs—critical for reliable interactions in multi-agent systems. By opening up their model checkpoints and synthetic datasets through platforms like Hugging Face, the authors not only promote transparency but also invite further research and collaboration in this crucial area of AI development.

## Abstract

> Despite rapid recent progress in the terminal capabilities of large language models, the training data strategies behind state-of-the-art terminal agents remain largely undisclosed. We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models. To accelerate research in this domain, we open-source our model checkpoints and most of our synthetic datasets at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-terminal.
