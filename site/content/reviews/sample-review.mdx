abstract: |
  This is a sample review demonstrating the Swarm-It research discovery platform
  with RSCT quality certification. The paper explores multi-agent coordination
  using quality gates and κ-score thresholds.

tldr: |
  • Demonstrates RSCT-certified paper review format
  • Shows κ-gate quality scoring (κ = 0.85, high quality)
  • Validates RSN simplex constraint (R+S+N=1.00)

## Summary

This is a **sample review** demonstrating the Swarm-It research discovery pipeline with full RSCT certification. The platform automatically validates:

- **κ-gate scores** (quality threshold κ ≥ 0.7)
- **RSN simplex constraint** (R+S+N=1.0)
- **Frontmatter schema** compliance
- **Reading time** calculation (auto-computed)

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Dark Mode Support
Toggle between light/dark/auto themes using the theme switcher in the header.

### 2. Quality Tier Classification
This paper achieves **High Quality** (silver tier) with κ = 0.85:
- κ ≥ 0.9 → Exceptional (gold)
- **κ ≥ 0.8 → High Quality (silver)** ← This paper
- κ ≥ 0.7 → Certified (bronze)

### 3. RSN Breakdown
- **Relevance (R = 0.35)**: Moderate connection to multi-agent systems
- **Stability (S = 0.52)**: Moderately reproducible approach
- **Novelty (N = 0.13)**: Low novelty, builds on existing work

Note: R+S+N = 0.35+0.52+0.13 = **1.00** ✅

## RSCT Analysis

### κ-Gate Quality Score
With κ = 0.85, this paper passes the standard quality gate (κ ≥ 0.7) and qualifies for the **High Quality** tier.

### Simplex Compliance
The RSN values sum to exactly 1.0, satisfying the simplex constraint required by RSCT's geometric framework.

## Methodology

This sample demonstrates:
1. MDX frontmatter validation during Gatsby build
2. Auto-computed reading time (based on word count)
3. Quality tier classification (from κ score)
4. Dark mode theme support

## Next Steps

Try these features:
- **Search**: Use the search box in the header (Phase 2 will add Fuse.js fuzzy search)
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle the theme (sun/moon icon)
- **Reading List**: Phase 2 will add bookmark functionality
- **Related Papers**: Phase 2 will show similar papers

- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ κ ∈ [0, 1]
- ✅ R+S+N = 1.0 (±0.01)
- ✅ Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
